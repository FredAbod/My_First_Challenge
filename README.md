### My Stack
1. Vscode as my work environment 
2. MongoDB as database 
3. NodeJs as my open source
4. Postman API for my Documentation

### Packages Used
* DOTENV - THIS IS A ZERO-DEPENDENCY MODULE THAT LOADS ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES FROM .ENV TO PROCESS.ENV. 
  WHAT THIS DOES IS STORES MY CONFIGURATIONS OR CREDENTIALS IN MY ENVIRONMENT
* EXPRESS - THIS IS MY FRAMEWORK and the de facto for nodejs
* MONGOOSE - THIS SERVES AS MY ODM/ORM (OBJECT DATA MODELLING/ OBJECT RELATIONAL MODELLING),
* WHAT THIS DOES IS CONNECT MY MONGODB AND MY NODEJS JAVASCRIPT
* MORGAN - THIS IS A MIDDLEWARE THAT HELPS ME LOG MY ERRORS AND REQUEST ON MY CONSOLE OR TERMINAL 

This can be seen in the package.json folder
